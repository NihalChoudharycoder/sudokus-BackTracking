# sudokus-BackTracking
A simple code to solve a pre-defined sudoku problem using Back-tracking algorithm

   I have used the pygame library to create a GUI for the game 
   you can find a lot of different types of methods that are used of pygame 
   
   Eg 1: pygame.display.update() :  allows to update a portion of the screen, instead of the entire area of the screen. Passing no                  arguments, updates the entire display
   
   Eg 2: pygame.time.delay(100) : pause the program for an amount of time (here, 100 secs)
Methods used :-
   1. def valid(bo, num, pos): to check if the given number in a position is right or wrong is called several time within the class grid and other places of cube as well.
